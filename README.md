### Hi, I'm Ines <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bruno-rose/Bruno-rose/main/wave.gif" width="30">

I'm a data scientist who is passionate about multiculturalism, running, and playing the piano and saxophone.

My research interests are transfer learning, foundational models, and causal inference.

- üéì I am a second year Data Science MS student in the [ICME department at Stanford University](https://icme.stanford.edu/).

- üìä I am currently a research assistant at [Summer Han Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/summerhanlab.html), where I work on evaluating the efficacy of surveillance strategies for lung cancer patients with causal inference and deep learning. 

- :syringe: Over the past year, I worked as a research assistant at [Boussard Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/boussard-lab.html), where I finetuned a BERT model for delirium identification in unstructured data.

- üéì I completed my math & engineering undergraduate studies at [Centrale Sup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and [Lyc√©e priv√© Sainte Genevi√®ve](https://www.bginette.com/), near Paris.

- üëó I did a 3-month summer internship as a data scientist at [Inditex](https://www.inditex.com/itxcomweb/en/home) in 2023.

- üåç I am French and Spanish, have lived and worked in three countries, and am consistently eager to explore new places and engage in cultural exchange experiences.
